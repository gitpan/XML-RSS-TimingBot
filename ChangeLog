Revision history for Perl extension XML::RSS::TimingBot
                                        Time-stamp: "2004-04-24 00:51:17 ADT"

2004-04-24  Sean M. Burke  sburke@cpan.org
	* Release 2.01 -- first CPAN release.

	This version now has docs.

	This version now supports etags.

	This version has a larger tast-base now, including even a test
	corpus of files.  That makes the dist much larger, but don't
	worry, all those fat files don't get installed, they're just test
	files.
	
	XML::RSS::TimingBotDBI is in its own dist now, to simplify the
	prerequisite-declaration stuff for you.
