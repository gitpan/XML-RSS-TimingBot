Revision history for Perl extension XML::RSS::TimingBot
                                        Time-stamp: "2004-05-19 12:57:23 ADT"

2004-05-19  Sean M. Burke  sburke@cpan.org
        * Release 2.03 -- important bugfix version
	* In the previous version, the maxAge method actually read and
	wrote tho minAge slot in the object!  This version fixes that.

	
	BTW: a 3.x version will be out soon.  It'll be smarter with the
	situations (which the current version doesn't handle well) of a
	feed that keeps returning an HTTP 304 even when we would have
	expected it to have updated.  (That often happens when a feed
	generator decides (rightly) that when there's no new content, it
	shouldn't bother touching the RSS file.)  The current version
	basically figures that until it gets an HTTP 200 (instead of the
	not-modified), a feed can be polled and repolled as often as we
	want.  The new version will instead poll the feed only once or
	twice per update period, even if the polls ever only return 304.

	
2004-04-30  Sean M. Burke  sburke@cpan.org
        * Release 2.02 -- first CPAN release.

	Added rss_semaphore_file and support for it.

	Added a longish note about "USING UNDER WITH LWP::Simple", for
	when want to just drop in this class in programs that's using
	LWP::Simple.
	
	
2004-04-24  Sean M. Burke  sburke@cpan.org
	* Release 2.01 -- first CPAN release.

	This version now has docs.

	This version now supports etags.

	This version has a larger tast-base now, including even a test
	corpus of files.  That makes the dist much larger, but don't
	worry, all those fat files don't get installed, they're just test
	files.
	
	XML::RSS::TimingBotDBI is in its own dist now, to simplify the
	prerequisite-declaration stuff for you.
