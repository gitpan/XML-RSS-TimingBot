  <title>Aquarius order finally in.</title>

  <description>I haven&apos;t even gotten through the first song on Five Suns yet (granted it&apos;s 45 minutes long), but it is eminently clear that I must forthwith and post-haste aquire the entire recorded output of &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.guapo.co.uk/&quot;&gt;Guapo&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;br /&gt;Vintage keyboards.&lt;br /&gt;Hypnotic bass lines.&lt;br /&gt;Amazing drumming.&lt;br /&gt;Rare but massive guitar.&lt;br /&gt;Simply amazing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Reference points:&lt;br /&gt;Ruins, with a longer attention span.&lt;br /&gt;Recent Boredoms.&lt;br /&gt;The few moments in Yes&apos; catalog that are neither singing nor soloing.&lt;br /&gt;Red-era King Krimson.</description>

  <title>Not my smartest moment.</title>
  <link>http://www.livejournal.com/users/genericus/147874.html</link>
  <description>When I was a wee lad, still wet behind the ears and not so wise in the ways of the world, I...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Who am I kidding.  This happened an hour and a half ago.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was at my desk playing &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.chratnox.de/swf/bubble.swf&quot;&gt;this&lt;/a&gt; (CURSE YOU, &lt;span class=&apos;ljuser&apos; style=&apos;white-space: nowrap;&apos;&gt;&lt;a href=&apos;http://www.livejournal.com/userinfo.bml?user=jwz&apos;&gt;&lt;img src=&apos;http://stat.livejournal.com/img/userinfo.gif&apos; alt=&apos;[info]&apos; width=&apos;17&apos; height=&apos;17&apos; style=&apos;vertical-align: bottom; border: 0;&apos; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;a href=&apos;http://www.livejournal.com/users/jwz/&apos;&gt;&lt;b&gt;jwz&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;!!!), and I was hearing rumbles.  It&apos;s not a typical sound at my business, but not unheard of either.  But as they kept happening, somthing in the back of my mind was going &quot;please, be thunder&quot;.  Finally one so monsterous happened that there was no question.  I lept up from my desk and made a beeline for the exit, looking over my shoulder to see if anyone in the office noticed me leaving.  No.  Good.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I get outside and it is COMING DOWN! in a way that doesn&apos;t happen in southern California very much.  I stand beneath the awning outside the door and let the door close...&lt;br /&gt;with my keycard inside, clipped to the jacket I&apos;m not wearing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Whatever, I&apos;m going to sit here and watch the rain and someone will eventually step out to see also.  I saw another flash  and heard the boom.  AWESOME.  No one else was wandering out to look, and I started to survey my surroundings for lighting safety.  Next to me is a chain-link fence.  On the other side is some trees and greenery and a very large condensor unit for the air conditioning in the building.  Ahead of me are various cars and a very wet parking lot.  I am standing outside a 2 story building, under an awning.  The building is obviously the tallest thing around for lightning to hit, but presumably far less of a ground source than the fence, the bottles of (filtration? high pressure caustic gas?) behind it, the cars, or the air conditioning.  And my shoes are now very wet.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I look in through the door hoping for a sign of life.  Nothing.  I can see the door that opens on the factory floor where there would have been workers a mere 15 minutes ago.  I steel myself for a sprint to the other side of the building in the pissing down rain commencing the moment the next lightning stike is complete.  The rain gets harder.  Is that...?  Yes.  It is.  It is hailing.  I look back through the door and laugh at my utter tardedness.  No strike ever comes, and the rain abates enough to do that run.  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Just before I go, I realize that my car is about 40 feet away.  I sprint to the car, start it, drive to the other side of the building, park, leap across the Amazon and stand outside that door for only about 30 seconds before someone exits.  He makes a quip about me going and getting his umbrella out of his car for him.  HA HA HA.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I walk the length of the building on the (thankfully deserted) ground floor, muttering to myself about the foolishness.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Not my smartest moment.</description>

  <description>Ah I was supposed to start being annoying now.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The original date of March 11 is OFF.  We are actually playing March 10.  That&apos;s Wednesday, a week from tomorrow.  We&apos;re on at 9:00 (not opening for once!!!)  We&apos;ll be unveiling a new song.  And possibly playing some songs that we haven&apos;t played live much yet.  It will be righteous.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;ALSO:&lt;br /&gt;In deference to &lt;span class=&apos;ljuser&apos; style=&apos;white-space: nowrap;&apos;&gt;&lt;a href=&apos;http://www.livejournal.com/userinfo.bml?user=citizenx&apos;&gt;&lt;img src=&apos;http://stat.livejournal.com/img/userinfo.gif&apos; alt=&apos;[info]&apos; width=&apos;17&apos; height=&apos;17&apos; style=&apos;vertical-align: bottom; border: 0;&apos; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;a href=&apos;http://www.livejournal.com/users/citizenx/&apos;&gt;&lt;b&gt;citizenx&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&apos;s &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.livejournal.com/users/torgo_x/26032.html?thread=3760#t3760&quot;&gt;SNAP!&lt;/a&gt;, I have &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.livejournal.com/users/genericus/info/&quot;&gt;subtitled&lt;/a&gt; this journal.</description>

  <title>Weekend</title>
  <link>http://www.livejournal.com/users/genericus/147219.html</link>
  <description>Sunday: &lt;br /&gt;I have decreed that my Sundays be &apos;cooking day&apos;, with an eye towards cooking things I wouldn&apos;t normally.  Breakfast was a breakfast burrito: eggs, garlic, onion, tomato, chipotle pepper, avocado, and cheese.  For dinner, I maked &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.foodnetwork.com/food/recipes/recipe/0,,FOOD_9936_15540,00.html&quot;&gt;this&lt;/a&gt;.  Mmmmmmm.&lt;br /&gt;Most of the in-between time was spent web surfing and playing Diablo and naps and doing the rest of the mixes for Hydra and burning a cd with all 6 mixes on it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Saturday:&lt;br /&gt;Spent about 6 hours getting all the levels for Hydra under control; once that was done the second and third mixes came quickly.  Folks came over for gaming: Played Fill or Bust (Sean won), Dominoes (I won), a game whose name escapes me that&apos;s essentially a board game version of Roller Coaster Tycoon (Ed won), and closed with Settlers of Catan (which I won - I &lt;i&gt;never&lt;/i&gt; win at Settlers!).  Transferred Damon&apos;s pictures of his trip to Ghana from his camera onto CD for him (and conducted a slideshow on my computer for everyone), and listened to the Highlife Allstars CD he brought me.  It&apos;s pretty much what I expected it to be: lots of major modes, guitars playing polyrhythmic single-lines, full horn section, all very infectiously danceable.</description>

  <description>Just out of curiosity (read: because it irritates me that I don&apos;t know this), does anyone know of a good reference page that will tell me how to type international symbols? (umlauts, accents, foreign currency signs, and greek and hebrew characters)  If you could point something out to me, I would be much obliged.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Artistically, I am in sprint mode right now.  I&apos;ve got a plan and I&apos;m heading full steam.  Woke up at 9 this morning, made coffee and went to work.  Just stepped out of the shower, I&apos;m gonna get some food in me, and go back to work where I shall probably remain until folks come over at 8 for teh gaming.</description>

  <title>Recording</title>
  <link>http://www.livejournal.com/users/genericus/146547.html</link>
  <description>So as part of Hydra I created a fun patch in the Lexicon.  It&apos;s very simple and Kaiserian - it has an LFO shifting the pitch between 6 half-steps to a full octave, and a random LFO turning the pitch shifter on and off.  So I&apos;d be playing and the output would randomly jump and octave, warp, and then jump back down.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It was good fun.  I recorded more solos than Bebe&apos;s got kids.  But for the intercessions of the evil triumverant of band practice/sleep/work I&apos;d probably still be recording.</description>

  <description>&quot;Come unto me,&quot; goes the old harlot&apos;s song. &quot;Come unto me you weary and heavily laden. Surrender your intolerable burden of freedom and I will fill your mouths with miracles and your bellies will be full of food. Come with me and I will confound your enemies and show you paradise. Look, you do not even have to change a name, only keep the letter and deny the spirit, for the letter giveth life.&quot; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;She is harvesting the nations now, that old whore, for an appointment in the place called Armageddon. There will be a hunting of free men in the name of freedom and there will be prisons and pogroms in the name of democracy, murder and slavery in the name of brotherhood, and all for the sake of dominion over the minds and bodies of men.&lt;br /&gt;--Jack Parsons, &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.antiqillum.com/glor/freedomsword.htm&quot;&gt;&quot;Freedom is a Two-Edged Sword&quot;&lt;/a&gt;</description>

I only had him for one quarter, but his attitudes and ideas went a long way in forming my compositional ideas - especially in the field of algorythmic composition.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Well, &lt;a href=&quot;http://arts.ucsc.edu:16080/faculty/cope/index.htm&quot;&gt;his faculty website is here.&lt;/a&gt;</description>

  <description>We stormed the terra last night.  It was glorius.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In other words, I played like shit (at least at first) but got a big pop when I was introduced.  Nice.  Genericus has a posse.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In other news, it was miserable and wet, the second band seemed good (I left the second song into their set to drop off equipment at the studio), the third band-the guys who hosted us-were fairly abominable death metal but seemed to enjoy themselves so whatever, and there was some drama incurred by people who are old enough to know better that I&apos;m tempted to write about but will abstain.</description>

  <description>In which I talk about the method used to write that sheet music I posted the other day, and in the process confirm my utter, and no doubt long-suspected, insanity to you:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.livejournal.com/users/guitar_deth/6366.html&quot;&gt;http://www.livejournal.com/users/guitar&lt;wbr /&gt;_deth/6366.html&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Or, rather than make you wade through all that crap that you probably don&apos;t care about, &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.noellairson.com/mp3/inprogress/guitar_solo.mp3&quot;&gt;here&apos;s the clip&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.livejournal.com/users/guitar_deth/6366.html#comments&quot;&gt;my commentary&lt;/a&gt;</description>
