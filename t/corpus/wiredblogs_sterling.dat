      <description>&lt;br&gt;This ticked-off report from the Union of Concerned
Scientists, about Bush political attacks on American
scientific integrity, sure makes for some dismal
reading.

      <title>Strategic Insights from the Zarqster</title>
      <link>http://wiredblogs.tripod.com/sterling/index.blog?entry_id=245922</link>
      <guid>http://wiredblogs.tripod.com/sterling/index.blog?entry_id=245922</guid>

      <description>&lt;br&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://wiredblogs.tripod.com/sterling/zarqawi.jpg&quot; align=&quot;left&quot;&gt;


http://www.cpa-iraq.org/transcripts/20040212_zarqawi_full.html

Got the full text of the captured Zarqawi letter here,
handily offered to a skeptical world public 
by the occupation government in Iraq.

&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.cpa-iraq.org/transcripts/20040212_zarqawi_full.html&quot;&gt;A Rare Example of a Terrorist Screed Getting Full-scale Publicity&lt;/a&gt;

Zarqawi being suspect number one in the recent massacre,
and supposedly a top jihad cadre on the ground.

&quot;Here is the current situation as I, with my limited vision, 
see it. I ask God to forgive my prattle and lapses.&quot;

Man, this is some kinda briefing document.  
It is beyond my wildest imagination.
I can&#39;t get over it.
It&#39;s kinda 105 percent prattle and lapses.

Y&#39;know, after having read this thing two or three times,
I&#39;m inclined to think it&#39;s authentic.  It&#39;s just too
weird to be made up.  Evidence number one being that
this letter showed up *before* a bunch of Shi&#39;ites got
blown to shreds in a coordinated wave of martyr
operations.  

This letter is just amazingly sinister, malicious, bonkers,
and cynical.  It reads like a crazed supervillain
from a Fu Manchu episode.  

Here&#39;s what he&#39;s trying to accomplish (as far
as I can tell):

First, the Americans get out of the way (as &quot;the most cowardly of God&#39;s creatures,&quot; they&#39;re bound to shy off anyway),
then they decapitate the Kurds with leader assassinations,
kill as many cops in Iraq as they can find, and, as the brilliant
hinge of the whole scheme, they provoke a wholesale bloody
massacre between Sunni and Shi&#39;ites in Iraq, so that all
the world&#39;s Sunnis will come to the rescue of the
dying Sunnis being lynched in the Sunni triangle. Then, all
the world&#39;s Sunnis, united at last under the banner
of a world-class no-kidding jihad, will devote heroic, suicidal
effort to a massive anti-heretic genocide that
somehow gets rid of all the zillions of Shi&#39;ites in Iran,
Syria, Lebanon, and the Gulf. 

So basically, it&#39;s the Iran-Iraq war again, only much
bigger this time, and, uh, really holy and pure.

The Americans can&#39;t be too thrilled by all this, since
they&#39;re trying to keep civil order there, but there
must be non-Moslem diplomats and intelligence agents
all over the world who are reading this letter and
hoping Zarqawi gets what he wants.  A giant fanatical
genocidal pogrom, strictly inside Islam, where everybody else
hopes both sides lose.  Gee whiz, what a relief
for the rest of us, eh?

&quot;The Qur&#39;an has told us that the machinations of the hypocrites, the deceit of the fifth column, and the cunning of those of our fellow countrymen whose tongues speak honeyed words but whose hearts are those of devils in the bodies of men &#150; these are where the disease lies, these are the secret of our distress, these are the rat of the dike.&quot;

*Takes one to know one, fella.</description>

      <description>&lt;br&gt;Aw man, that takes the cake.
Gates&#39; software is such a haxxor playground
that worms are fighting *each other* now.
Thanks for the news there, SANS.

[Editor&#39;s Note (Tan): Bagle and NetSky are fighting with each other. In NetSky.F, researchers found the following text: &quot;Skynet AntiVirus - Bagle - you are a looser!!!!&quot; This NetSky worm variant tries to remove Bagle worm infection if it finds it on an infected computer.

      <title>The Chairs of Bam</title>
      <link>http://wiredblogs.tripod.com/sterling/index.blog?entry_id=244764</link>
      <guid>http://wiredblogs.tripod.com/sterling/index.blog?entry_id=244764</guid>

      <description>&lt;br&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://wiredblogs.tripod.com/sterling/P21.jpg&quot; align=&quot;center&quot;&gt;


As you may recall, before the more recent outburst
of utter Mideastern mayhem, on the day after Christmas 2003,
the ancient mud-brick Iranian town of Bam got cracked and
flattened by an earthquake.


So, a bunch of Americans from the National Iranian
American Council go over to help out.  They
take a whole lot of pictures.

http://www.niacouncil.org/pressreleases/press163_a.asp
&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.niacouncil.org/pressreleases/press163_a.asp&quot;&gt;NIAC doing something useful about it&lt;/a&gt;

Time hangs pretty heavy on your hands when
you&#39;re living in a tent city refugee camp.
Here some kids in Bam are whiling away
the hours playing musical chairs in their 
headscarves. 

&lt;p align=&quot;center&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://wiredblogs.tripod.com/sterling/P15.jpg&quot; align=&quot;center&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br clear=&quot;all&quot; /&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;entry&quot;&gt;


Check out those injection-molded,
stackable, lightweight, eminently transportable,
durable, infection-free, monocolor, ultra-cheap,
weatherproofed, dustproofed, likely designed in America,
probably made in China, garden chairs.

Disaster tourists may come and go, but those
chairs, man, those things are the very efflorescences
of globalization.

      <title>Another Red-Letter Day for the Cause</title>
      <link>http://wiredblogs.tripod.com/sterling/index.blog?entry_id=243750</link>

Okay, so it&#39;s a Shi&#39;ite high holy day, and so,
in glorious support of worldwide Moslem self-determination,
Pakistani terrorists and the Iraqi resistance blow
up and shoot a whole bunch of highly pious Moslem Shi&#39;ites 
right outside their mosques.   

http://www.rferl.org/featuresarticle/2004/03/61d96cf4-114d-4abf-8294-cb17444cfc28.html
http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?f=/news/archive/2004/03/02/international0935EST0544.DTL

Suicide attacks, international, closely coordinated, 
all on the same day, Pakistan, Iraq, just about as shocking
to decency as one could get... say, you don&#39;t suppose
that could be Al Qaeda, do you?

One has to stand in awe at such self-immolating genius!
What if Al Qaeda actually *won* this titanic struggle, eh?
Suppose everybody in the world turned into a
Moslem just like them! 

What would we possibly do for an encore?  Would we cut
off, fry up and eat our own feet?

But no, that&#39;s not all!  (How could it be?) Check this out:

&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.nti.org/d_newswire/issues/2004_3_1.html#AF05959C&quot;&gt;&quot;Iran Threatens Terrorist Action in Libya If Tripoli Reveals Nuclear Information&quot;&lt;/a&gt;

*Yep, that&#39;s the Iranian Revolutionary Guard, training Libyan
Afghan vets to go and kill Muammar Qadhafi.  Mullahs Versus
Qadhafi, in a down and dirty intra-Moslem terror-war!  It must
take a lot to make Mossad guys smile these days,
but that&#39;s just gotta be doing it.

In Pakistan, it gets even better.  It gets *lots* better.
&lt;a href=&quot;http://newyorker.com/fact/content/?040308fa_fact&quot;&gt;The indefatigable Seymour Hersh&lt;/a&gt;


They shot the wife of a North Korean
diplomat and stuffed nuke parts into her coffin.
Way back in June &#39;99.  
http://www.pakistan-facts.com/article.php/20030119104517296
&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.pakistan-facts.com/article.php/20030119104517296&quot;&gt;So-called &quot;Pakistan Facts,&quot; hmm, they look pretty Indian to me, just at a guess&lt;/a&gt;


*Nah, this just can&#39;t be.  Somebody made that story up, right?
It&#39;s just too Axis of Evil.  It&#39;s not enough
that Pyongyang and Islamabad swap nuke hardware,
but a dead spy wife and a coffin? 

*Who on earth invents this farfetched, sexed-up tittle-tattle?  
CIA? Mossad?  Indian RAW?  British secret services?
The neo-cons in the Office of Special Projects?  
The Russian FSB?  The Moonies at Washington Times?
Fox News?  The South Koreans?  Maybe the Chinese,
they would surely know a lot about it....

Hey wait a minute --
look at that huge list I just wrote!
Everybody in the world despises Pakistan.
No wonder they have to use those coffins!

http://www.atimes.com/koreas/CF05Dg02.html
&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.atimes.com/koreas/CF05Dg02.html&quot;&gt;Asia Times, the news is all over the map&lt;/a&gt;

*Was the dead Korean woman *in a burqa*
inside her coffin?  That would have pretty well 
done it, eh?  Maybe there are pictures!</description>

      <title>Welcome to Somalia, Wish You Were Virtually Here</title>
      <link>http://wiredblogs.tripod.com/sterling/index.blog?entry_id=239630</link>
      <guid>http://wiredblogs.tripod.com/sterling/index.blog?entry_id=239630</guid>

      <description>&lt;br&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://wiredblogs.tripod.com/sterling/1020MAP.gif&quot; align=&quot;left&quot;&gt;

Okay, Somalia is the quintessential &quot;failed state,&quot; right?
Fourteen years as a national basketcase.  The poster
child for the New World Disorder.  And now what?
The Somalis are having a telecom boom, swarming with mobile
phones, and pumping money in and out.

&lt;a href=&quot;http://search.csmonitor.com/durable/1997/10/20/intl/intl.4.html&quot;&gt;How to cash in on chaos&lt;/a&gt;

Does this mean they&#39;re gonna settle down now (with
the fourteenth warlord peace deal in fourteen years)?
Maybe.  Or maybe it means that global telecommunications
and globalized diaspora money transfer, by
its very nature,  powerfully aids and abets a 
miserable condition of armed, criminal disorder.
You be the judge!

&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.opendemocracy.net/themes/article-2-1727.jsp&quot;&gt;Somalia&#39;s Popular Romance With the Internet&lt;/a&gt;

&quot;The virtual state 

&quot;(...) For although Somalis have found it difficult to reach an agreed political basis for their national community, among the many paradoxes of this East African country is that people&#146;s use of the latest technological advances exceeds that of many other countries. Internet cafes, the latest mobile phones and digital communications are booming. It takes just L0.35 per minute to call from London to Mogadishu, the capital.

&quot;The telecommunication boom has transformed the lives of hundreds of thousands of people. Along with telecommunication service, thousands of smaller companies offer banking services such as money transfer, depositing and buying shares.

&quot;Money-transferring companies, in particular, have been the &#145;life-savers&#146; of many Somalis. Returnees from the Somali diaspora have made heavy investments in communication technology and a sophisticated financial system for the remittance of money to Somalia. Many of the estimated 2 million Somalis (from a population of around 8 million) living outside the country have found ways to communicate with and assist financially their next of kin living inside the homeland.&quot;
