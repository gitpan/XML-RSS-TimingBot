  <description>These walls are made of sand. And just as soon as they&apos;re all up the ocean comes rushing back in. Sometimes I&apos;m just so fucking stupid about everything.</description>

  <title>A Few Of My Favorite Things</title>
  <link>http://www.livejournal.com/users/meta_kate/24909.html</link>
  <description>I&apos;ve been in a real depression spiral lately, so I thought I would make a list of the little things that make me happy. This is an experiment, so bear with me. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1. All Things Considered on NPR: The familiar voice of Robert Seagull saying &quot;You&apos;re listening to All Things Considered from NPR news.&quot; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2. My friend Stacey. She is one of the sweetest people I have ever met. She&apos;s completely authentic. There&apos;s nothing artificial about her. She couldn&apos;t be other than what she is if she tried and it&apos;s fabulous. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;3. Prime Suspect and Cracker.  DCI Tennison and Fitz are supremely cool.  British cop shows rock my world. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;4. Cold Newcastle. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;5. Curling up with a good book and getting lost in it. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;6. The last three months of the year. I really like October, November and December. I&apos;m not a big fan of the other months.</description>

  <title>Home, again</title>
  <link>http://www.livejournal.com/users/meta_kate/24010.html</link>
  <description>The plane did not fall out of the sky. I&apos;m again grateful for science I don&apos;t understand. Now I get to commence with worrying about my friends planes&apos; not falling out of the sky.  The trip to SoCal was interesting. I miss Lisa already. Other than that, good to be home.  At least in my temporary home. I have a few days of quiet ahead before real life need be dealt with. Finally finished Buffy v.5 which made me cry, a lot. Yup. Buffy the Vampire Slayer made me cry.  It was good to see most of y&apos;all.  And I have some more to say about that but I&apos;m not sure that this is the place to say it. Except, thank jeebus, I had the sense cover my blond hair. So for now, I&apos;ll just be grateful for Xanex and science. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Being back is nice. There are bits of snow everywhere and that&apos;s lovely. I got a very sweet message from a friend today and that made me feel really good about being back. But I miss the safety of knowing some of you are there. Now I&apos;m here and I can&apos;t call have you show up at my parents&apos; house on Christmas night. But it was nice to realize that some people aren&apos;t quite who I thougth they were. At the time it hurt, but it is good to see someone thru different eyes. My perspective has shifted, again. Some of y&apos;all are exactly the same and it didn&apos;t see it before and some of y&apos;all are really as good as I&apos;d hoped for.  It hurts a lot to be back here.  And I&apos;ve got to stop typing y&apos;all.</description>

  <description>I don&apos;t usually like Bust that much. They claim to be feminist, but yet they have helpful feminist tips like &quot;Is sewing the new knitting? We think so!&quot; Don&apos;t get me wrong, it&apos;s not that everything needs to be a brain-in-the-thumbscrews Dworkinesque rant. In fact I would prefer nothing to with feminism sounding like Andrea Dworkin. That&apos;s not the point though. Reading Bust at the tire repair place the other day I found this&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.ocma.net/Exhibitions/exhibitions.html&quot;&gt;Girls Night Out&lt;/a&gt;. Something cool I want to do that will actually be happening when I&apos;m not in school. You know you all want to go because it&apos;s at the museum with the sculpture that&apos;s making the roof collapse. Who in?</description>

  <description>Because I won&apos;t have time to breath between now and then:  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Happy Birthday, &lt;b&gt;Ms. Maygoon&lt;/b&gt; and&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Happy Birthday, &lt;b&gt;Natz!&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I know that it&apos;s not for a day or a few, respectively. So consider this your preemptive birthday strike. Unfortunately I have not substitute&apos;s fortitude with computer magic, so I can not post a nifty Rove-O-Gram for his birthday. Instead I shall conjure up thoughts of Phyllis Schalfly or Anne Coulter giving him a nice big hug.</description>

  <description>Someone has taken out an easement in my head. An easement is an access right, a use right if you will. I feel like my psyche is being split in half. I walk around like a giant bruise. I feel like my heart is beating outside my chest, constantly exposed to anyone who wants to take a shot. The slightest thing throws me. I had my first law school exam and a hideous adrenaline hangover to go with it. My head and my heart both want to explode. After our Civ Pro exam, I went to lunch with some friends, promptly puked my guts out and then drove around crying for awhile. At 24, I feel like dork driving around sobbing, but it did anyway. It took awhile for me to settle enough to be able to come home and sleep. My next final is Thursday. I hope I don&apos;t have the same horrid emotional backlash. This class sucks and makes ache all over. I&apos;ve been studying Property nonstop and its making me crazy. I&apos;ve put Tori on constant rotation. Today I had to get out of the library so I went to a friends house. It was good. She fed me some lettuce and made the bad go away. I have too much to do tomorrow. The least of which is review Rule Against Perpetuities. Standing outside the library today, I almost lost it. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And when I come home its not much better. I&apos;m used to Brian and me explaining the stuff we&apos;re working on to each other. Before there was a common background. Now there&apos;s nothing. I can&apos;t answer his questions because I don&apos;t know enough and I can&apos;t explain what I&apos;m doing because there&apos;s just too much. There&apos;s nothing to say about the sixteen hours I&apos;m not at home beacause there&apos;s no way to explain it. There&apos;s no way to explain most of what I&apos;m doing now. It feels like what&apos;s left of kate is being written over by something else. I&apos;m not changing. The entire make up of me feels like it is being altered at fundamental level.</description>

  <title>Sloshing in the Rain</title>
  <link>http://www.livejournal.com/users/meta_kate/22226.html</link>
  <description>Today we had a snow day. I walked around in my silly shoes and made squelchy noises. It was fun. People may mock my four inch platforms, but they&apos;re suddenly cool when rats invade the office or in randomly snows.  I made patterns in the slush with my shoes. I resisted the urge to do a sloppy rendition of Singing the Rain. And Moses Supposes his Toeses are Roses.  In between I went to class. In K today we got lectured about being in elementary school. I&apos;m telling you snow day+plus long day+K = law school students throwing snow balls. Even the ashtrays were frozen. I think I like snow days, except for the driving part. I drove in the snow for the first time today. Kewl. A friend helped my scrape the snow off my window. I think there&apos;s something about this weather that makes a lot of people a lot nicer.</description>

  <description>There seems to be a distinct lack of hope in my outlook on life. Lately I&apos;ve been missing that feeling of being on the cusp, like my &quot;real&quot; future is about to begin. I remember times when I felt like my whole life was about to open up for me. All I had to do was struggle to create the right confluence of circumstances and the whole world would finally burst open with all of its possibilities. Well, I guess it did and now I&apos;ve chosen where I want to go and I there is a curious sense of &quot;is this is it?&quot; School seems to be going well. I have an accidental rep. Home life is fraught with kitten goodness but I still miss my sense of belonging. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We&apos;ve all been at school for just under eight weeks now it seems like a massive social vetting is going on. People are figuring out who they like and why they like them. A few of are feeling the ache for home.  What&apos;s kind of scary is that even though this law school is not supposed to be competitive, the pressure is heating up. People who haven&apos;t joined your study group suddenly dropping by seems suspicious. It&apos;s bizarre.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The worst part for me is that I feel like I&apos;m another dimension most of the time. I really want to stay connected with my friends, but at the same time I can&apos;t convey how much this entire experience is affecting me. My entire perspective has been radically affected by the last eight weeks. I pretty much eat, think, breath and drink legal.</description>

  <title>Tonight is lame and full of whine</title>
  <link>http://www.livejournal.com/users/meta_kate/20462.html</link>
  <description>While reading livejournal I&apos;ve become quite envious. I envy people who have settled friends, jobs and the like. This is a lame emotion to have, but I feel it welling up. I&apos;m feeling rather rootless at the moment. I don&apos;t have a place to ground myself, and yet I am discontent with my present position. Tonight I browsed excellent philosophy grad programs I could have gotten into. From my current perspective, that seems like an extremely desirable place to be. I went to a workshop about outlining today and basically got smaked for not spending enough time studying because I don&apos;t spend two to four hours studying for every hour of lecture. Hell, for all I know I do. I just don&apos;t measure it. Fortunately the people I study with are much less up tight than I am.  In the aforementioned workshop, you were also supposed to figure out whether you should do a &quot;right-brain&quot; or &quot;left-brain&quot; outline. Yeah, thanks, that was helpful. I think I&apos;ll just see which half retained the relevant information as soon as I can figure out what qualifies as relevant information. Also, peer editing sucks. If you know you are not good at legal writing, how are you supposed to critique someone&apos;s work? Hi, this is what didn&apos;t work. Ignore that and do the opposite of everything I say because my last assignment was significantly sub-par. Blerf. Going to play with cats and go to bed now.</description>

  <description>School is progressing. BriEnigma and I had a chat  about memetic systems last night. It started out with him asking me if I&apos;d seen a certain schema. The really sad part was that the whole chat (okay debate) seemed easy. Right now, law makes everything hard. Contracts kicked my ass today. I managed to miss the whole point of an exception to very important rule because I interpreted &apos;unless&apos; incorrectly. Instead of reading it correctly, I read unless as having the same meaning it does under the logical calculus. Oops, wrong interpretation. But no mass embarrassment. That was Monday when I missed the crucial exception to the exception of the rule. Oops. Law school is one big oops right now. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Lately I&apos;ve had a horrid wave of homesickness. The cats don&apos;t help. It&apos;s kind of sad. Kitty love cures almost everything else. I miss being able to go to the local coffee place and see my friends, regardless of uncomfortable run-ins. I also really miss being able to call someone see if they want to go out for a drive, coffee or chat. In short (my legal writing teacher would be proud), I miss all of you in SoCal more than you know.</description>

To add value to this process, you must also add one band to the list, and remove one band from the list, before passing the list on (including these instructions).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Adding: Siouxsie and the Banshees&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Siouxsie and the Banshees&lt;br /&gt;Joy Division&lt;br /&gt;The Clash&lt;br /&gt;The Beatles&lt;br /&gt;XTC&lt;br /&gt;Devo&lt;br /&gt;Queen&lt;br /&gt;R.E.M.&lt;br /&gt;The Kinks&lt;br /&gt;The Beach Boys&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Removing: The Minutemen&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Edited to add substitute&apos;s addition.

  <description>It just hit me that I am in law school.  I&apos;ve been aspiring to be here for about twenty years. It is frightening to finally be immersed in this experience I&apos;ve wanted for so long. I feel very lucky right now. I could still be in sub-prime finance. I feel like I should fall on my knees and thank the universe for getting me here. It&apos;s really hard and I complain about that, but some part of me just wants to do the dance of joy because I&apos;m learning things I&apos;ve always wanted to, even though those things are often boring. How the hell did I get to this? I swear I&apos;ve made about a million mistakes on my way here, but I&apos;m still here. Right now, this feels great.</description>

  <description>Today was DMV experiment day.  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Hypothesis: DMV employees and procedures are just as annoying and useless in one state as they are in other. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Method: Too many telephone calls and visits to branch offices.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Experiment Results:  From observable specimans, it would appear that DMV employees both over the telephone and in personal interaction are more annoying in California then they are in Oregon. It can also be observed that the subjects in the Oregon group are more enthusiastic about actually helping patrons than their California counterparts.  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Interesting side note: Talk Like A Pirate Day was invented by two Oregonians, according to Robert Siegel on All Things Considered.</description>

  <title>THIS OPINION IS LESS STUPID</title>
  <link>http://www.livejournal.com/users/meta_kate/18219.html</link>
  <description>While I&apos;m usually not happy when Chief Justice Rehnquist writes the majority opinion because that means the politcal outcome of the decision is less liberal than I&apos;d like, lately I&apos;ve developed an affinity for his opinions. Some of the other justices just go on and on with their reasoning. He writes clearly, logically and persuasively. His reasoning proceeds point by point and usually with rambly policy stuff.  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Strangley enough, the only other justice whose style I find as palatable is the late Justice Brennan. Go figure. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In other news, I think I&apos;m actually learning some cool stuff in law school. We&apos;ve progressed past dead foxes and dead ducks in Property.  Contracts is getting trickier, but it is still the most exciting subject. The weather here has also gotten much more palatable. It&apos;s nice to go back to school in the fall and have the weather actually meet my idea of what fall weather should be. It&apos;s been raining on and off until today, which was actually sunny and rather pleasant.  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Portland and the whole hippie law school vibe is starting to take its toll on me. Today BriEnigma and I went ot REI to get a good reusable, refillable water bottle for school and an insulated lunch bag cooler thing so I can take leftovers to school and microwave them.  Since this little outing was the highlight of my day, I think that perhaps it may just be law school helping me redefine what actually constitutes as fun in my small world.</description>

  <description>In re my previous post, contentment can be acheived by organizing your desk.  Yes my friends, the sublime has been found.   My school/office supplies are not only at home, they are organized and proudly displayed.  You too can experience such unrivalled contentment by enrolling in law school and completing only one pititful and puny task .I have one calendar on the computer with details of classes, reading schedules etc. And one on my desk. They are synchronized.  See below.  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a name=&quot;cutid1&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://netninja.com/images/lj/katedesk2.jpg&quot; width=&quot;600&quot; height=&quot;450&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://netninja.com/images/lj/katedesk1.jpg&quot; width=&quot;600&quot; height=&quot;450&quot;&gt;</description>

  <description>Orientation is over and I&apos;m already in over my head. I have a giant to-do list and my credit card bill is going to painful.  To cheer me up I have a shiny new collection of very heavy books including the engaging tome of &lt;u&gt;Selected Commercial Statutes&lt;/u&gt; and the elucidating volume ominously titled &lt;u&gt;Property&lt;/u&gt;. When I told a kind-hearted 2nd or 3rd year that I had a certain Contracts professor she started giggling in a maniacal sort of way. w00t!  Even better, my TA for Legal Writing told us to stock up on toilet paper because by October we wouldn&apos;t actually have time to shop for it.  Yeay!  Later this evening I get to go shopping for school supplies and all matter of food that can be easily prepared. (Read microwaved)  On a slightly less bookish note, I met some people who seem pretty friendly today.  One of them even smokes. Also got to meet the Intellectual Property Organization crew. They seemed pretty cool.  Apparently there is an awesome cyberlaw professor at the school. This cheers me.  Now I just need to find the cr1m3zzzzz club and life will be good.  I&apos;m about to get swept up into a mind-boggling whirlwind. Does anyone know how to organize a whirlwind?  If you do, please let me know. The TA who suggested the toilet paper told us to also schedule free time.  Yup, assume all time is for organizing except those precious fifteen seconds that you have to breathe deeply.  Better start scheduling.  One more thing, if any one has some good suggestions for classical music, I&apos;d be grateful.</description>

  <description>Apparently the some LDS chapters do not reject partying and the evil of liquor. I know this because the youth of the LDS are having quite a revelary right outside my front window.  They are in the parking lot right in front of my complex and sounding much akin to Peninsula youths. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Went out to inspect as a reslut of the noise, behaving much like peninsula or other Newpie  youths.</description>

  <description>BriEnigma just brought down the plaque that my cow-orkers at Ratz&apos;R&apos;Us mortgage co. gave me as a going away present.  I got misty eyed.  It&apos;s not quite as bad as that time I was online at 3am and shopping for shoes and reading Harry Potter fanzines simultaneously, but it&apos;s close.</description>

  <description>I feel like I should make some sort of update post about the trip from home to the great Northwest.  Since I&apos;ve been lax about updating things here&apos;s a boring list of the good and the bad.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Good:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1. Trees&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2. No Sales Tax&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;3. Embarking on a career that will enable me to extend my career options beyond moving &quot;upstairs&quot; in the literally rat-infested sub prime mortgage industry.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;4. I&apos;ve miraculously discovered a cure for my fear of flying. (Drive through - by my definition - three scary high places and have panic attacks of varying degrees each and every time. Chain smoke while unable to breathe well and start screaming that the mountains are evil death curves of hell and should be demolished and filled in with concrete.  Make usually  stoic mother start laughing because hysterical fit about mountain driving has reached satiric proportions.  Continue crying, while starting to realize self has gone off deep end. Start giggling with Mom eventually. Calculate flight time from Portland to the OC.  Realize that boring and lame driving time aside, it is actually much quicker to panic on airplane for about 3.5 hours than it is to panic through, from North to South, Grapevine, Shasta County and Grant&apos;s Pass.  Also, student health plan should cover enough trips to GP to cover road tests for Xanex and Valium. I&apos;ve heard both may help although not together.  Suggestions welcome.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;5. Although I&apos;m voting in the recall, the state in which I currently reside is going to be governed by the Terminator, nor was said election created by busy and goofy people lamely signing things outside the Target in Irvine or comprable area. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;6. New groovy apartment. Insanely sympathetic partner, who is going way out of his way to accomadate my current mental state. The possibility of cats, and maybe someday a dog.  Did I mention CATS?!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;7. Much closer to the Canadian contingent. Makes probability of meeting them better, I hope. BriEnigma and I would one day like to meet the most excellent folk from up north.  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bad:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1. Random crying jags suppressed in the Safeway because something reminded me of something that makes me miss my mom. I&apos;ve actually avoided going into a few stores with BriEnigma because I was afraid I couldn&apos;t control my tears. Nothing special. Just someplace I went with my mom exploring our new neighborhood before she left. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2. I miss Lisa. A few days ago I finished a book she lent me and now I can&apos;t go out for coffee and talk it over with her.  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;3.  Fear of failure. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;4. No calling cool people to come over and have a coffe and smoke on the patio and check the new place out. No cool people to call. &lt;br /&gt;    Corrollary: May never meet said cool people. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;5. General bleah.  (Not as productive as I hoped I would be.  Too many hours spent reading to contain depressive episodes. Not enough time spent dealing with unpacking and whatnot.)</description>
