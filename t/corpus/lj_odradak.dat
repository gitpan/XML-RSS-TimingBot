  <description>Manny has an inner ear infection. He got a shot yesterday and gets antibiotic drops twice a day. He seem a bit better, even if he really really hates getting the drop. It&apos;s a possiblity that, when his world stops spinning, he may be a sideways bird for the rest of his fluffy life. Poor guy.&lt;br /&gt;The alarm on my cell phone died just as I was going to turn it off. For some reason, it made me say &quot;in his West German home&quot;. I&apos;ve had Terror Couple Kill Colonel in my head since then. Weird.&lt;br /&gt;The boss bought a cd/dvd burning and labeling robot. &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.primera.com/ComposerXL/&quot;&gt;So cool.&lt;/a&gt; Print quality could be better and it doesn&apos;t transform into anything or have death rays, but it&apos;s still pretty neat.</description>

  <description>Today I will start working in the office, again. Let&apos;s hope my car doesn&apos;t die.&lt;br /&gt;The deadline was a month ago. Not my fault. I hope they understand that.&lt;br /&gt;A break from 3d would be helpful. I&apos;m seeing everything in polygons again.&lt;br /&gt;I am afraid of everything.</description>

  <description>I&apos;ve been &apos;taking stock&apos;. I think what I really need to do is get out of the country for a bit. Very important.&lt;br /&gt;I was trying to remember Moscow. The thing that sticks out the most is the black snow being dumped in the river every morning from massive concrete embankments with various Soviet emblems carved into them while I watched Tom &amp; Jerry reruns. As a SoCal kid, it was very surreal. The Kremlin was preatty dern cool, too.</description>

  <description>Last night, watching TBN, I heard the science guy&apos;s best evidence against evolution. Irrefutable proof, and I can&apos;t believe I didn&apos;t see it before, is found in the simple fact that two of the planets in our solar system run backwards.&lt;br /&gt;I thump bibles now.</description>

  <description>ATLANTA, Georgia (AP) -- The state&apos;s school superintendent has proposed striking the word evolution from Georgia&apos;s science curriculum and replacing it with the phrase &quot;biological changes over time.&quot; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.cnn.com/2004/EDUCATION/01/30/striking.evolution.ap/index.html&quot;&gt;http://www.cnn.com/2004/EDUCATION/0&lt;wbr /&gt;1/30/striking.evolution.ap/index.html&lt;/a&gt;</description>

  <description>So I was about 10 minutes late, but I was forgiven as the directions she gave me weren&apos;t the best, she confessed it.&lt;br /&gt;The place used to be a nightclub. It doesn&apos;t seem to have changed, as there were still speakers and lights hanging from the ceiling. There were lots of metal things all over the place and a great big mirror ball over a large chunk of cubes where the dance floor used to be. My interview was in the meeting room that had a massive glass industrial door, not a massive rusted iron one like the lobby. A filing cabinet was next to a drum kit. It was all terribly hip and, oddly, there was NO NOISE.&lt;br /&gt;It went well, I suppose.</description>

  <description>Unless the bank needs something else in it that they haven&apos;t told me about, the 3d project is done. If they like it enough to give me, er, I mean my boss, the next project, I&apos;d be Safe As Houses.&lt;br /&gt;A few days ago, I ran across a job listing with a phone number. it was Socially Hazardous. I said I&apos;d call them back. I haven&apos;t. Something tells me that working for &apos;L&apos; wouldn&apos;t make me feel Safe As Houses.&lt;br /&gt;I still haven&apos;t talked to my boss about the 1099 problem. Also not Safe As Houses.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;HA!</description>

  <description>There is a tedious Kids in the Hall sketch about an architect and two gentlemen representing his client. The two gentlemen express their concern about &apos;the atrium&apos; and that they might have to lose it as it&apos;s just not in the budget. The architect has an outburst and the sketch goes on too long.&lt;br /&gt;After receiving an email this morning detailing the last minute changes that the bank wants to their 3d whoosh flying pneumatic tube check out that conference table animated year end presentation, I had an outburst and really want an art director to whine at. As I am my own art director, I whined at the cats and my coffee.&lt;br /&gt;Long story short, I&apos;m now very upset at myself for being so upset. It&apos;s a corporate presentation, not a masterpiece, and I shouldn&apos;t get my beret in a bundle.</description>

  <description>Another computer dream.&lt;br /&gt;I discovered that whenever Lightwave crashed on XP, its button panel would stay open and would not close until rebooted. I then noticed that the buttons would change depending on what program was open. I could then use the panel to control the focused program, the television and, in  some cases, the stove and water heater.</description>

  <description>Fever down. Head full of snot.&lt;br /&gt;I had a horrible, terrible nightmare. The taskbar on my copy of Eudora light had filled up with so many ad-button-things that there was no way it could all fit on the screen. The highest resolution I could get was 1024x768. Horrible. Terrible.&lt;br /&gt;I am forced to acknowledge Christmas.</description>

I got learned.&lt;br /&gt;Watched Zentropa and a show on the Discovery Channel that was supposed to explain some of the physics behind martial arts, it was in fact just a two hour trailer for that Tom Cruise Dances With Bushido hunk of crap.&lt;br /&gt;We have a Christmas tree.&lt;br /&gt;Beth has more terrific news from Matrix Direct.

  <description>It is too freaking early, but I&apos;m awake anyway.&lt;br /&gt;For Justice.&lt;br /&gt;For my terrible crime.&lt;br /&gt;For nine freaking hours.&lt;br /&gt;For God&apos;s sake I hope the instructor isn&apos;t funny.&lt;br /&gt;I had set several alarms for 5.30. A nightmare woke me up at 5. More time for coffee.&lt;br /&gt;Delicious, wonderful coffee.&lt;br /&gt;Justice does not sleep.&lt;br /&gt;Neither does coffee.&lt;br /&gt;Too freaking early.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;Time to pay the price.&lt;/i&gt;</description>
