City Council member Jackie Goldberg, now in the state Assembly, and her partner of 28 years, poet and activist Sharon Stricker, were among six gay and lesbian couples married yesterday at San Francisco City Hall.  Another longtime leader in the Los Angeles gay community, Torie Osborn, took the plunge with her partner, Lydia Vaias. Osborn is executive director of the Santa Monica-based Liberty Hill Foundation. State Sen. Sheila Kuehl presided. <a href="http://www.latimes.com/news/local/la-me-marry9mar09,1,4219592.story?coll=la-headlines-california">L.A. Times story</a>.</p>]]></content:encoded>

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>In the months after 9/11, many travelers gave up flying to drive instead, thinking it "safer."  The end result was 350 more traffic deaths, author and Hope College social psychologist David G. Myers writes on today's <a href="http://www.latimes.com/news/opinion/commentary/la-oe-myers9mar09,1,303957.story">LAT op-ed page</a>.</p>

<blockquote>
Why do we intuitively fear the wrong things? Why do smokers fret about flying? Why do we fear violent crime more than clogged arteries? Why do we fear terrorism more than accidents, which kill nearly as many in a week in just the U.S. as did worldwide terrorism in all of the 1990s? Even with the horrific scale of 9/11, more Americans in 2001 died of food poisoning than terrorism.

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A sampling of book deals from today's <a href="http://www.caderbooks.com/">Publishers Lunch</a> weekly. Non-fiction:</p>

<div class="setoff">
&#149;&nbsp;Journalist and critic James Sullivan's AMERICAN BLUE, the story of blue jeans, from their development in the days of the California Gold Rush, to their adoption by cowboys, farmers, bikers, and hippies, to their transformation into designer clothing in a new global era, arguing that they are not only a seminal American icon, but the very embodiment of the American ethos. Gotham.

<p>&#149;&nbsp;Details Editor-at-Large Jeff Gordinier's untitled book about the California music scene of the 1970's, exploring the complex relationships among artists such as The Eagles, Linda Ronstadt, Jackson Browne, Warren Zevon, and others who together created a revolution in American rock music. William Morrow.</p>

<p>&#149;&nbsp;Ben Gazzara's memoir, IN THE MOMENT, chronicling the acclaimed actor's 50 years as a screen and stage star (Cat on a Hot Tin Roof, Anatomy of a Murder, Husbands), including his pioneering role in the Actor's Studio, his friendships with Elia Kazan, James Dean, and John Cassavetes, and hs affair with Audrey Hepburn.

</div></p>

<p>And a couple of heavyweights in fiction:</p>

<div class="setoff">

Houghton Mifflin, for publication in October 2004. 

<p>&#149;&nbsp;Gore Vidal's IMPERIAL AMERICA, an Olympian survey of American Empire, where America is an "Enron-Pentagon prison," a land of ballooning budget deficits thanks to the growth of the garrison state, tax cuts for the privileged, and the creeping totalitarianism of the Ashcroft justice department, the conclusion of a political trilogy, following the bestselling Perpetual War for Perpetual Peace and Dreaming War. Avalon for Nation Books, for publication in July.<br />

Gray was 62. He was last seen on the Staten Island Ferry on Jan. 10. That day, he  took his kids to see <i>Big Fish,</i> walked the family dog and called one of the children to say he loved him and would be home soon. That call was later traced  to the ferry terminal.</p>]]></content:encoded>

Yes, I have sold out to The Man™ and will soon be blogging for cold, hard cash...

<p>It's still going to me blogging about whatever I feel like, although hopefully with more opportunity to do a bit of reporting here and there and to make a few contacts I otherwise couldn't.<br />

<p>Calpundit is a rare partisan website that even the other sides seem to respect. Congratulations Kevin.</p>]]></content:encoded>

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Those following the end of Sandra Tsing Loh's six-year run as a KCRW commentator may want to tune in <a href="http://www.marketplace.org/">Marketplace</a> this afternoon.  <a href="http://cathyseipp.journalspace.com/?entryid=267">Cathy Seipp</a> says that Loh (who also comments for that show) expects to do a bit on her firing from KCRW over broadcasting the f-word.  Marketplace airs at 2 p.m. on <a href="http://www.kcrw.com/cgi-bin/db/kcrw.pl?tmplt_type=program&show_code=mp">KCRW</a>   (89.9 FM) and 3 p.m. on <a href="http://www.scpr.org/schedule/">KPCC</a> (89.3 FM).  Seipp: "The question is whether KCRW will air it." </p>

<p>Seipp, a longtime friend of Loh's, is <a href="http://cathyseipp.journalspace.com/?entryid=268">fomenting</a> retaliation in the form of withholding financial support from the Santa Monica station.  She credits Variety's Bill Higgins with the campaign's slogan: No Loh, No Dough. She notes also that Harry Shearer opened "Le Show" on KCRW Sunday with "pointed allusions to 'Bleep Nation.' "</p>

<p><i><b>Update:</b> Don Barrett at <a href="http://www.laradio.com">LARadio.com</a> emailed his readers Loh's Sunday commentary in the L.A. Times. At least one local radio veteran was unimpressed:</i></p>

<blockquote>
"Oh, please. The woman dropped an F-bomb on a microphone. We don't do that, period. Never have,” emailed Dave Williams, morning co-anchor at KNX. “She can romanticize it all she wants and imagine herself Joan of Arc if it helps her live with her oversight. She wanted it bleeped? Why didn't she say the word, ‘Bleep?’ We screw up, we get caught, and we get fired. End of story.” 
</blockquote>

<p><i><b>Update II:</b> Seipp has the <a href="http://cathyseipp.journalspace.com/?entryid=269">script</a> of Loh's commentary for Marketplace. KCRW isn't mentioned by name -- and yes, it aired unmolested in Santa Monica.</i></p>

<blockquote>
Speaking as someone who lived and worked for years in a string of petty Third World dictatorships, I believe I'm well qualified to predict the behavior of the regime of the recently declared Republic of Eisneria.

<p>Like other dynasties that rule by fiat and deception (self- and otherwise), Walt Disney Co. management is likely to engage in the reinterpretation of reality, the misrepresentation of electoral results, the lionization of dupes and the execration of dissidents. Disasters will be rationalized away and victories exaggerated. Truth will no longer be an objective thing, but will emanate by diktat from members of a small, insular circle devoted to the glorification of the Big Man, to whose reputation and authority their own will be inextricably tied.</p>

<p>Some of these phenomena are already evident at Disney, where Chief Executive and ex-Chairman Michael Eisner continues to hold on to his chair with what George Orwell would have called a "prehensile bottom."<br />

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Noam N. Levey, the new guy in City Hall for the Times, <a href="http://www.latimes.com/news/local/la-me-mayor8mar08,1,3105475.story?coll=la-home-local">takes stock</a> of the potential lineup of challengers to Mayor Jim Hahn and finds enough interest out there to complicate things for the mayor.  Hahn won by riding the Valley and the black vote, but the hopefuls thinking about a run include Valleyites Richard Alarcon and Bob Hertzberg and the former police chief Bernard Parks, thought to be popular with blacks.  Alarcon and Antonio Villaraigosa, if he runs, might grab a lot of Latino and liberal votes.</p>

<p>It could all leave Hahn without much of a core group of supporters, at a time when the grand jury investigations into alleged corruption in the city departments could soil his image.  "There is blood in the water, and the sharks are circling," says Fernando Guerra, director of the Center for the Study of Los Angeles at Loyola Marymount. Still, Hahn has $1.3 million in the bank, and no incumbent mayor has lost since 1973.  Also, none of the potential rivals has yet had the gumption to openly admit he is running (though Alarcon says he will take out papers this week).</p>

<p><i><b>Update:</b> David Zahniser does a <a href="http://www.dailybreeze.com/content/news/1930524.html">similar piece</a> in today's Daily Breeze, quoting Jaime Regalado of the Edmund G. "Pat" Brown Institute for Public Affairs saying of Hahn: "He is definitely vulnerable." Zahniser, as does Levey, includes controller Laura Chick among the prospective candidates.</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

Among them is a book party to be thrown by the LA Weekly next week for its own writer, Marc Cooper. His book is <i>The Last Honest Place in America: Paradise and Perdition in the New Las Vegas.</i></p>

<p>In other book news, journalist Joe Domanick's <i>Cruel Justice: Three Strikes and the Politics of Crime in America's Golden State</i> is out this month from <a href="http://www.ucpress.edu/books/pages/9684.html">UC Press</a>.  His last book <i>To Protect and to Serve: The LAPD's Century of War in the City of Dreams</i> won the 1995 Edgar Award for Best True Fact Crime. </p>

<p>Richard Horgan's <a href="http://www.filmstew.com/Content/ReviewsViews/Details.asp?Pg=1&ContentID=8082">column </a> at FilmStew.com is on Beverly Gray, whose biography of Roger Corman -- her former boss --  has been updated and re-released. It's called <i>Roger Corman: Blood Sucking Vampires, Flesh-Eating Cockroaches, and Driller Killers</i>.</p>

<p>And the latest <a href="http://www.jackliffey.com/">Jack Liffey</a> mystery from John Shannon, <i>Terminal Island</i>, is coming in May. The books are rich with Los Angeles locales and lore. This one is set in San Pedro and there's a launch party planned for the San Pedro branch library on April 18.</p>]]></content:encoded>

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://web.venturacountystar.com/blogs/therdt/">Timm Herdt</a>, newly linked on the left, is state bureau chief for the Ventura County Star. He blogs mostly about politics on the Star's site, and in a recent item admitted the reaction to his recent speech before the Camarillo Democratic Club. A lady came up after and said, "I love your column...but like many people who have a talent for writing, you are a lousy speaker. You nearly bored us to death." </p>

<p>On Sunday, the paper's editor, Tim Gallagher, guest-blogged on the scene at this weekend's off-the-record, pol-packed Gridiron Dinner in Washington, where he schmoozed with the likes of Dick Cheney, Maureen Dowd and Howard Dean.</p>

<blockquote>
The roof nearly fell in when Dean appeared in one skit as himself and closed the song by recreating the scream he made famous after his loss in the Iowa primary. Dean appears to be a good sport about the whole thing. He sat directly across from me for most of the evening and howled at the jokes focused on his riches-to-rags campaign story.
</blockquote>

<p>Gallagher wrote that the prevailing buzz had President Bush skipping the dinner in order to snub the Wall Street Journal's Al Hunt.<br />

(See <a href="http://www.laobserved.com/archive/001504.html">LAT's anti-abortion opera</a>).
